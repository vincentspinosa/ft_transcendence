# Transcendence Backend SSL Certificate Generation Script
# 
# This script generates self-signed SSL certificates for development purposes.
# It creates the necessary cryptographic files needed to enable HTTPS on the
# local development server.
# 
# WARNING: These are self-signed certificates intended ONLY for development.
# They will trigger browser security warnings and should NEVER be used in
# production environments.
# 
# Features:
# - Automatic creation of certificates directory
# - Generation of 2048-bit RSA private key
# - Creation of certificate signing request (CSR)
# - Generation of self-signed certificate valid for 365 days
# - Proper file permissions for security
# - Clear output messages and instructions
# 
# Security Notes:
# - Private key is set to 600 permissions (owner read/write only)
# - Certificate is set to 644 permissions (owner read/write, others read)
# - 2048-bit RSA provides adequate security for development
# - 365-day validity prevents frequent regeneration needs
