/**
 * Transcendence Full Stack Startup Script
 * 
 * This script automates the complete startup process for the Transcendence project,
 * including both frontend and backend components. It handles dependency installation,
 * building, SSL certificate generation, and server startup in the correct order.
 * 
 * Features:
 * - Automatic dependency installation for both frontend and backend
 * - Frontend build process with webpack
 * - Backend TypeScript compilation
 * - SSL certificate generation if needed
 * - Comprehensive error checking and validation
 * - Clear progress indicators and status messages
 * - Proper directory navigation and management
 * 
 * Prerequisites:
 * - Node.js and npm must be installed
 * - OpenSSL must be available for certificate generation
 * - Script must be run from the project root directory
 * 
 * Usage:
 *   ./start-full-stack.sh
 * 
 * @author Vincent Spinosa
 * @version 1.0.0
